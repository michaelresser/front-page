<h1>Personal Project:  Front Page Clone</h1>
<h2> README </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This repo is a self-assigned project to review and 'clone' the portfolio site of a UI designer/developer I respect, Taylor Ho. 
Taylor's OG site & work may be viewed here: www.taylorkmho.com 

I chose his site because of its simple, yet intelligent, single-page layout, and subtle use of animations and modals to transition between topical areas. 

<h3>Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li> HTML5 |CSS3 | JS </li>
  <li> Jquery </li>
  <li> Waypoints JS </li>
  <li> Lost Grid</li>
  <li> </li>
  
</ul>

Thanks for Looking!
