<h1>Personal Portfolio Page</h1>
<h2> README </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This is the repo for my personal protfolio of web dev work. Hand Coded using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, and a touch of JQuery (for a plugin).
The design ws inspired by the portfolio site of Taylor Ho, a UI designer/developer of of CA. I really liked his simple, elegant minimalist UI and wasnted to see if i could reconstruct his splash page graphic. It evolved into my own interpretation from there.  

Taylor's OG site & work may be viewed here: www.taylorkmho.com 

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hand Coding a Responsive Layout is maddening. I have so much more respect for responsive libraries like Bootstrap, depsite their individual drawbacks.</li> 
<li>I was particularly inspired by the method of bundling all the animation JS into a simple class, which is then instantiated and called on the main app, for clean-easy to follow JS animations.</li> 
<li> WaypointsJS + the Web Animations API syntax for easy and awesome scroll-triggered animations.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li> HTML5 | CSS3 (Sass) | JS | Jquery </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> WaypointsJS </li>
  <li> Lost Grid</li>
  <li> Magnific Popup</li>
  <li> Wallop Slider</li>
</ul>

Thanks for Looking!
