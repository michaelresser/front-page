<h1>Personal Portfolio Page Project</h1>
<h2> README </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This repo is a self-assigned project build a personal protfolio page using layout and ideas borrowed from the portfolio site of a UI designer/developer whom I respect, Mr. Taylor Ho. 

Taylor's OG site & work may be viewed here: www.taylorkmho.com 

I chose his site because of its simple, yet intelligent, single-page layout, and subtle use of animations and modals to transition between topical areas. 

This projecti exposed me to using Sass for SUPER simple CSS & WaypointsJS + the Web Animations API syntax for easy and awesome scroll-triggered animations. 

<h3>Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li> HTML5 | CSS3 (Sass) | JS </li>
  <li> Jquery </li>
  <li> WaypointsJS </li>
  <li> Lost Grid</li>
  <li> </li>
  
</ul>

Thanks for Looking!
